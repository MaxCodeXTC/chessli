I couldn't imagine learning without it anymore. Anki Cards Design The interactive chess functionality on the cards is taken from these fantastic cards . You can find a great video about those cards here . Further Awesome Tools : Most of the heavy lifting, e.g. parsing games, finding mistakes, extracting openings, etc. is done with python-chess . The communication between lichess and chessli is done via berserk . The CLI is built with typer . The rich colors are made possible with rich . The apy tool is used to programmatically import the chess knowledge into Anki. You should really check those tools out; each and everyone one of them is amazing.","title":"Acknowledgements"},{"location":"acknowledgments/#acknowledgments","text":"Lichess : A free, no-ads, open source chess server that let's everyone play chess!

Anki Support via apy In order to directly \"ankify\" your mistakes, openings and tactics, you need to set up apy . Currently chessli is compatible with apy version 0.6.0 and anki version 2.1.26. Please refer to its install instructions for detailed information. Lichess API Authentification Some parts of the lichess API, for example fetching your puzzle activity, require authentification. For this purpose, you need to get a personal API access token . Put your token into configs/lichess.token . For more information read the corresponding berserk documentation section .
